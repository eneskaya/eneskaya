### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a product-oriented web engineer, working across the full stack. I live in ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Germany with my beautiful wife and son. I currently work at [Spotify](https://github.com/spotify). Check it out!

I founded two companies, where I've learnt to love working on all facettes of a product, from conception to fund-raising, to marketing. I have also worked at larger organizations, like Spotify. Lately, I focus on frontend engineering with React and experiment with building my own software business.
